# 🚀 Premium Developer Portfolio

A high-performance, responsive portfolio platform built with **Angular 21** to showcase professional experience, technical skills, and creative projects with a focus on premium UI/UX.

## 📖 Project Overview

In a crowded job market, a static resume isn't enough. This project solves the problem of "visual credibility" by providing a live, interactive demonstration of my frontend capabilities. It moves beyond simple text to show real-time API integrations, complex lifecycle-based animations, and a mobile-first architectural approach.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Framework:** Angular 21 (utilizing **Signals** for reactive state management)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Styling:** Bootstrap 5 & Custom SCSS
* **Animations:** Angular Browser Animations Engine (`@angular/animations`)
* **Integration:** EmailJS API for serverless contact form handling

## ✨ Key Features

* **Dynamic "Z-Pattern" Gallery:** An alternating project layout that maintains visual interest and flow.
* **Staggered Reveal Animations:** Professional entry effects for UI elements using Angular's native animation triggers.
* **Reactive Contact System:** A fully validated contact form that sends real-time emails without a dedicated backend.
* **Skill Grid with Brand Icons:** A curated list of technologies featuring customized DevIcons for high-contrast visibility.
